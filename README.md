# SVM_and_Decison_Tree
This is an exercise i did for my college's subject "reconhecimento de padr√µes" (patern recognision)

In this exercise i implemented the SMV and Decision Tree AI models
I also did data normalization, calculate the metrics (accuracy, precision, recall and f1-score).
Finally, i ploted the confusion matrix for each model.
